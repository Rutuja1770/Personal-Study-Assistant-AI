## 📖 How It Works (Workflow)

User uploads a study PDF

Text is extracted and split into chunks

Chunks are converted into embeddings

User asks a question

Relevant content is retrieved using similarity search

Context + question is sent to local LLM

AI generates an accurate response

Chat history is stored in session memory
